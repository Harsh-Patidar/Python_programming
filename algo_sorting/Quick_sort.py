# # Quick Sort Algorithm:

# 1..Also called as partition Exchange Sort

# 2..Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961

# 3..When implemented well it can be about 2 or 3 times faster than the its main competitors merge sort and heap sort


# Quick_sort:
#   -- Comparison Sort -- so here we compare the value
#   -- In_place  --- in_place algo is nothing but it may requries small adition amount of memory
#   -- Unstable --is nothing but the relative order of equal sort item is not preserved like if you are sorting a list and it contains the duplication values the order thry wiill appear in the input may not be the same in the output 
#   -- Recursive Algorithm --

# ***** THIS QUICK SORT IS DIVIDE AND CONQURE ALGORITHM:   *****

# 1.DIVIDE_-
#         --In this we have to take pivot element...
#           PIVOT ELEMENT:--
#             1. first element 
#             2. last element
#             3. random element
#             4. median of three values(first, middle, last)

#             first element and last element is the easyest way but when sorted list or reverse sorted list given...this is the BAD CHOICE
