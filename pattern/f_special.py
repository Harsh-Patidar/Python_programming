n = 1

    for _ in range(row):
        print(n, end=" ")

The total number of elements is 10. Therefore, the time complexity of the code is O(10), which is effectively O(1) when considering constant factors. This is because the number of iterations in the loop is directly proportional to the number of elements youre printing, and the loop only runs a fixed number of times regardless of the specific value of n.

this solution uses only one outer loop to iterate over each row and an inner loop to print the numbers in each row. It achieves the desired pattern in O(n) time complexity.

******* for _ in range(row): in this what is _ ?**************
In Python, the underscore character _ is often used as a "throwaway" variable name. It is commonly used when you want to iterate over a sequence of values and you don't actually need the values themselves, only the act of iterating a certain number of times.
